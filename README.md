<h1>Frog-Blender</h1>

Famous old Frog Blender 2000 game remake for Mac, written in Swift. Are you feeling nostalgic?
The project uses images, sounds and videos taken from the original old game. The gameplay is managed with overlay buttons on top of an AVPlayer. 

However the game is available online, it requires Flash player, so I wanted to make a native Mac app that doesn't depend on old unsafe technologies like Flash. Enjoy! :wink:

**Main game:**
